Hi, Iâ€™m @Dickson419 a Computer Science teacher in the UK and a MSC student. 

I am fairly familiar with Python but I am looking at expanding my knowledge and learning analytics with Python. I am starting to learn Java which I am really enjoying. 

Prior to programming my background is in networking and telecomunications.
